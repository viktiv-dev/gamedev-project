# Blog Post #5 - Level Design Milestone

## Introduction

This blog post summarizes the progress on level design for the grappling hook game, highlighting the layout creation, pacing considerations, and integration of gameplay elements like anchors, enemies, and the timer.

## Progress Made

- **Level Layouts:**
  - Three levels have been created, each introducing new challenging layouts.
  - Anchor points are placed strategically to encourage exploration and skillful grappling.
  - Verticality and gaps are used to create a sense of depth and challenge.
- **Gameplay Pacing:**
  - Early levels focus on teaching basic grappling mechanics with safe anchor placements.
  - Later levels introduce multiple anchor points, requiring chaining hooks and planning movement.
  - Enemy placement and hazards are used to create tension without overwhelming the player. Same with enemy speed (like the turret rotation)

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Balancing Anchor Placement:**
  - Issue: Some anchors were unreachable or too easy to reach.
  - Solution: Iterative testing with the player to ensure all anchors are reachable but require skill.
- **Integrating Enemies Without Frustration:**
  - Issue: Enemies sometimes blocked critical paths or made levels unfair.
  - Solution: Adjusted enemy patrols and positions to create challenge while maintaining fairness.
- **Level Progression Feedback:**
  - Issue: Players needed clear indications of objectives and progression.
  - Solution: Added visual cues for anchors, level start, and end points, including tutorial guidance for early levels.

## Next Steps for Level Design

- Refine level layouts based on player testing and feedback.
- Add more complex anchor patterns and environmental obstacles.
- Introduce optional collectibles or challenges to encourage replayability.
- Fine-tune enemy placement to maintain a balance between challenge and flow.
- Ensure smooth transition between levels with visual and audio cues for completion.
